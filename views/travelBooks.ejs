                <h1> 15 Travel Books That Will Change The Way You See The World </h1>
                <h2> <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Rings-Saturn-W-G-Sebald/dp/0811226158/" >“The Rings of Saturn” </a> by W.G. Sebald </h2>
                <p> “Travelogue? Memoir? Novel? W.G. Sebald’s account of a walking tour of the English county of Suffolk defies categorization. The narrator meanders a few miles down the coast, but his mental journey feels far greater. This book blends beguiling descriptions of the places and people he encounters with meditations that range from the history of herring fishing, to colonialism in the Congo, to the reign of a Chinese empress,” said Kay. “‘The Rings of Saturn’ contains a philosophy for travelers who want to scratch beneath the surface of a destination: Take it slow, seek out stories, strive to be a more thoughtful explorer. Take a copy of this one-off with you, and cultivate your sense of curiosity with every step—who knows where it might lead you?” </p>

                <h2> <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Moveable-Lonely-Planet-Travel-Literature/dp/1786572095"> “A Moveable Feast (Life Changing Food Adventures Around The World)” </a> edited by Don George</h2>
                <p> Some of us live to travel, and travel to eat. And when you need a book to fuel a gourmand journey, “A Moveable Feast” has got you covered with this celebration of 38 foodie tales from around the world, said Debbie Arcangeles, host of the podcast The Offbeat Life, which highlights the lives of location-independent professionals.</p>
                <p> “‘A Movable Feast’ is a compilation of short stories from famous chefs, writers and foodies around the world,” she said. “They all share a love of food and the power it has to bring people together. Reading the short stories will give you a glimpse of the culture and induce a serious case of food lust.” </p>
                
                
                <h2> <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Art-Travel-Alain-Botton/dp/0375725342"> “The Art of Travel” </a> by Alain de Botton </h2>
                <p> With so much travel literature telling us where to go, we can lose sight of the purpose behind traveling at all. Alain de Botton’s “The Art of Travel” serves as a reminder of the how and why when it comes to hitting the road, said Michelle Halpern, travel blogger at Live Like It’s The Weekend. </p>
                <p> “Many travel-themed books play to our daydreams about travel, but de Botton takes a brutally honest and philosophical look at why we travel and brings to light truths that we don't want to see or believe, namely that the fantasies we have about a place can often be better than the reality we encounter once we arrive,” she said. “He's incredibly articulate when describing the mundane moments of travel that we often glaze over in memory. It's not just about the moments of grandeur—every little element is part of the whole experience.” </p>

                <h2> <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Alchemist-Paulo-Coelho/dp/0062315005"> “The Alchemist” </a> by Paulo Coelho </h2>
                <p> Most travelers are searching for something on their adventures, whether it’s amazing archeological sites or the most delicious meal. But while you’re busy seeking something external, you usually end up discovering a piece of yourself you never knew was there. That’s exactly what happens in Paulo Coelho’s book, “The Alchemist,” said Cory Varga, travel expert and founder of the couple’s travel blog You Could Travel. </p>
                <p> “Tony comes to us in this book a little older, a little more worn, and above all, wiser and apologetic for his staunch stances of the past. He's still the same Anthony Bourdain, with the same convictions about what makes good cooking, but the years on the road have softened his soul in this memoir,” she said. “Travel changed Anthony Bourdain. It opened his eyes to a world that was forgiving and kind, to a world of people less fortunate than him, but who were happier than he could ever be, and it taught him the importance of stepping outside your comfort zone as a means to growth.” </p>
                
                <h2> <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Lands-Lost-Borders-Journey-Silk-ebook/dp/B0746HBWK1"> “Lands of Lost Borders: A Journey on the Silk Road” </a> by Kate Harris</h2>
                <p> The drive to seek out the unknown is what’s behind many people’s urge to travel. But where do you go when you feel that every place on earth has already been visited by millions before you? Is there any place left to discover? Kate Harris contemplates these questions, and more, in her memoir about a year spent cycling the Silk Road. </p>
                <p> “This book was like no other travelogue I've ever read—a meditation on remote places very rarely written about, history and borders,” said travel enthusiast Elizabeth Sile, senior editor at Real Simple. “Harris perfectly captures what it feels like to want to explore—not to take the perfect Instagram or tick off the top sights, but to be exposed to wildness and discomfort.” </p>

                <h2> <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Woman-Alone-Travel-Tales-Around/dp/158005059X/"> “A Woman Alone: Travel Tales From Around the Globe” </a> edited by Faith Conlon, Ingrid Emerick and Christina Henry de Tessan</h2>
                <p> The sheer number of “what ifs” when considering a solo trip is enough to keep many travelers at home. “A Woman Alone” will help you conquer the fear of exploring alone and encourage you to do it on your own terms, said travel influencer Tanyka Renee. </p>
                <p> “My initial issue with wanderlust was that I never had anyone to take trips with me. I spent years pushing adventures to the back burner due to my fear of traveling alone,” she said. “‘A Woman Alone’ is filled with relatable stories from solo female travelers that are real, transparent and uplifting. This book will give you the push you need to face your fears and see the world all by yourself.” </p>
